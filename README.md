**PatchSim** is a modular metapopulation simulation framework for multi-disease epidemiological modelling.

---

## Vision

To develop a general-purpose, modular simulation framework for patch-based metapopulation epidemiology, enabling modellers and researchers to simulate disease transmission under diverse scenarios, diseases, and intervention strategies. The framework balances robust scientific modelling with flexibility for exploratory research and translational use cases.

---

## Core Features

PatchSim aims to support a range of modelling features commonly used in metapopulation disease simulations:

- üó∫Ô∏è **Spatial Networks**: Represent geographical units (e.g., subdistricts, regions) as interconnected patches with movement/contact matrices.
- üë• **Stratification by Population Attributes**:
  - **Age groups**
  - **Species (e.g., cattle, buffalo)**
  - **Risk groups or occupations**
- üß™ **Disease Agnostic Compartment Models**:
  - SIR, SEIR, SIRS and extensions
  - Supports both discrete timestep and ODE-based solvers
- üõ†Ô∏è **Scenario and Parameter Management**:
  - Batch simulations for scenario comparison
  - Sensitivity analysis and parameter sweeps
- üßµ **Reproducibility**:
  - Random seed control and metadata logging
  - Version-tracked configurations
- üì¶ **Modularity**:
  - Plug-in architecture for solvers, interventions, and input data pipelines
